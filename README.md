# ðŸ©º Breast Ultrasound Dataset for Breast Cancer Classification

Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection is key to reducing the number of early deaths. This dataset provides ultrasound scan images categorized into **three classes** â€” **normal**, **benign**, and **malignant** â€” and is designed to support machine learning tasks in classification, detection, and segmentation of breast cancer.
